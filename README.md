Hello from the Dark Side!
Чи вірите ви у Темну Сторону Сили?

Feel the Force
Just Feel that Force.
No sign of divorce.
It’ll keep you on course.
It’s everywhere,
Not just a Star Wars fiction.
It may be God out there,
The cure for our affliction.
Whether The Force like us can think
Who knows?
Maybe we’re on the brink
Of its ebbs and flows.
All around there’s a Spiritual World,
Or so some say:
It’s yet unfurled
But we are on our way.
So Feel the Force
I say again.
Time runs its course,
Do ya ken?
As Yoda would say,
Your mind you open
And powerful you will become.
The darkness is caling.
